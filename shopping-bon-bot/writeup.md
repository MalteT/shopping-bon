# Shopping-Bon

- using `Raspberry Pi Zero W`, `Bon-Drucker(?)`, `Telegram`, `Rust`

## Idea:

- have a way of entering shopping items for me and my gf
- sort them ideally for an easy shopping tour
- print them using a bon printer

- The selected mode of input: Telegram
- Items need to be added to categories manually on first enter. Categories will be sorted manually once
- Language of choice: Rust


- Should I have seperated list for different shops? Or just support groceries?

## Commands:

- enter new item
- (enter new category)
- print list

## TODO:

- [o] Commands:
    - [ ] Send Message to be printed
    - [X] Print shopping list
- [ ] Categories:
    - [ ] Use categories
    - [ ] Add category emojis
    - [ ] Sort according to categories
    - [ ] Make adding categories possible
